## Notes from the lecture

* console.log(__dirname) => It returns the path of the directory in which it is located

* sendFile() => sends files to frontend from server by automatically sending the content-type header file
* download() => downloads the file that is sent
- sendFile() and download() works in all types of static files

* path.join() => we use path module to concat two paths like as in string concatenation
* Headers in Network of inspect element is just like meta tag in HTML which provides information to the browser regarding the content
